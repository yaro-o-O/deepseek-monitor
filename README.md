## ✨ Why DeepSeek Monitor?

The official DeepSeek platform shows your balance and usage scattered across different pages — and the usage dashboard doesn't even have a refresh button. **DeepSeek Monitor** puts everything on one compact dashboard:

- 💰 Balance at a glance, **auto-refreshed** while you work
- 📊 Per-model token consumption, cache hit rates, and costs for **V4 Flash & V4 Pro**
- 📈 7-day trend charts with daily drill-down
- 🪟 Stays in your **system tray** — one click away, never in the way

<!--
How to add screenshots:
1. Open the app, press PrintScreen (or use Win+Shift+S on Windows / Cmd+Shift+4 on macOS)
2. Crop the main dashboard and the model details view
3. Save them to assets/screenshots/ as dashboard.jpg and details.jpg
4. Uncomment the two lines above

## 🚀 Features

- **Balance alerts** — get a system notification when your balance drops below a threshold you set (once per threshold crossing, per account)
- **Multi-account support** — manage several DeepSeek accounts and switch between them in one click
- **Per-API-key breakdown** — split the month's requests, tokens, cache hit rate and spend across every API key of the account, from the official usage export (auto-fetched with the usage token, or imported as a ZIP/CSV)
- **Encrypted credentials** — API keys and usage tokens are encrypted at rest using your OS keychain (Electron `safeStorage`)
- **In-app auto-updates** — new releases are detected and installed right from the app
- **Real-time balance monitoring** — query your DeepSeek account balance with one click; live available amount and account status
- **Dual-model usage stats** — track token consumption, cache hit rate, and spending for V4 Flash and V4 Pro separately
- **7-day trend charts** — visualize the last 7 days of token usage, broken down by cache hit / cache miss / output
- **Usage drill-down** — click a model card to see per-day token consumption and request counts
- **Auto refresh** — 1 min / 5 min / 30 min / 1 hour intervals
- **Launch at startup** — supported on Windows and macOS
- **System tray** — closes or minimizes to the tray instead of quitting, summon it anytime
- **Always-on-top widget mode** — pin the window above other apps; hovering over it auto-hides or fades it to a preset opacity (click-through, so it never blocks your work) and it restores once the mouse moves away (controllable from the tray menu too)
- **One-click token sync** — built-in browser login window that captures your usage token automatically

## 📦 Installation

### Option 1: Download the installer (recommended)

Grab the latest installer from the [Releases page](https://github.com/guniang2/deepseek-monitor/releases) — no Node.js required.

### Option 2: Build from source

**Prerequisites:** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) ≥ 18 and npm (or yarn).

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/guniang2/deepseek-monitor.git
cd deepseek-monitor

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run in dev mode
npm start

# Or with dev tools
npm start -- --dev
```

### Packaging

```bash
# All platforms
npm run build

# Windows (NSIS installer)
npm run build:win

# macOS (DMG image)
npm run build:mac

# Linux (AppImage)
npm run build:linux
```

Build artifacts are output to `dist/`.

## 🧭 Getting Started

### First-time setup

1. Open the app and go to **Settings** (⚙ icon)
2. **API Key**: paste your DeepSeek API Key (starts with `sk-`), click "Verify & Save"
3. **Usage Token**:
   - **Option A (recommended)**: click "Sync via web login" — complete login in the popup window and the token is captured automatically
   - **Option B**: click "Paste token manually" — copy the Bearer token from your browser's dev tools

### Dashboard reference

| Area | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Account balance | Total balance and availability status; pick an API key to scope the usage figures below |
| Today's spend | Accumulated spend for today (account, or the selected API key) |
| Month-to-date | Accumulated spend for the current month (account, or the selected API key) |
| V4 Flash / V4 Pro | Per-model monthly tokens, spend, and cache hit rate (selected account, or the selected API key) |
| By API key | Per-key requests, tokens, cache hit rate and spend for the selected month |
| 7-day trend | Token consumption bar chart; hover for daily details |

### Auto refresh

Enable "Auto refresh" in Settings and pick an interval — the app will keep balance and usage data up to date on schedule.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Electron** — cross-platform desktop app framework
- **Native HTTP/HTTPS** — talks to the DeepSeek API directly, zero extra HTTP client dependencies
- **Vanilla frontend** — no UI framework, pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- **electron-builder** — packaging & distribution

## 🔌 API Endpoints

The app uses the following official DeepSeek endpoints:

| Endpoint | Purpose | Auth |
|----------|---------|------|
| `GET /user/balance` | Account balance | API Key |
| `GET /models` | Available models | API Key |
| `GET /api/v0/usage/amount` | Usage statistics | Usage Token |
| `GET /api/v0/usage/cost` | Cost statistics | Usage Token |
| `GET /api/v0/usage/export` | Monthly usage export (ZIP with per-key breakdown) | Usage Token |

## 🔐 Configuration Storage

Config (API key, usage token, auto-launch, etc.) is stored in `config.json` under your system's user data directory:

- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%/deepseek-monitor/config.json`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/deepseek-monitor/config.json`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/deepseek-monitor/config.json`

> **Security note**: the API key and usage token are encrypted at rest via the OS keychain (`safeStorage`) on Windows and macOS. On Linux without a keyring they fall back to plain text.

## 📝 Notes

1. **Usage token expiry** — tokens captured via web login may expire; re-sync if usage queries fail
2. **Balance vs. usage** — balance queries use the API key; usage statistics use a separate usage token
3. **Multiple currencies** — if an account is billed in several currencies, costs are shown per currency (e.g. `¥6.04 + $0.65`) and never converted or summed together
3. **Windows auto-launch** — via registry key `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`
4. **macOS auto-launch** — via `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.deepseek.monitor.plist`
